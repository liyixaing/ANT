    <string name="eqweqdczxcw">                     \t\t  Replacement of private key is the problem that ANT can it log in to account due to lack of understanding of block chain, unskilled operation and improper preservation of private key. Second, it develops the function of account and private key reset.\n\n

\t\tWhen the user loses the private key and cannot log in to the account, after specific verification, the system will import the account data of version 1.0 from the previous server and reset the account password and private key for the user.\n\n


\t\tNote: Since the previous server only records ANT asset data, only ANT-related assets can be restored after reset. Other assets, including but not limited to ETH, will be lost permanently. Therefore, the majority of users are requested to operate cautiously and keep their private keys and passwords in order to avoid property losses.\n\n</string>

    <string name="AnswerIssueSubmit">                       Submit answers</string>
    <string name="AnswerIssue1">                            1. The private key is your only identity certificate on the chain. If the private key loses or forgets the private key password, it will not be retrieved in any way.</string>
    <string name="AnswerIssueAnsuer1">                      Private keys are generated by "elliptic curve encryption algorithm" with the computing power of ordinary computers. If the private keys are lost, they will not be retrieved.</string>
    <string name="AnswerIssueAnsuer2">                      After the loss, you can use the mobile phone number and verification code to retrieve.</string>
    <string name="AnswerIssue2">                            2. The private key created in ANT Token can be retrieved by contacting customer service, providing mobile phone number, verification code and wallet address if I accidentally lose it?</string>
    <string name="AnswerIssue2Ansuer1">                     Unable to retrieve, all the private keys used in ANT Token are computed from the devices used in user generation. As a decentralized app, ANT Token does not backup any user is private keys.</string>
    <string name="AnswerIssue2Ansuer2">                     Yes, it can be retrieved through the ANT Private Key Security Center.</string>
    <string name="AnswerIssue3">                            3. Is the conceptual description between private key, public key and address correct?</string>
    <string name="AnswerIssue3Ansuer1">                     Private key, public key and address can be converted at will. If one of them is known, the other two can be deduced.</string>
    <string name="AnswerIssue3Ansuer2">                     A private key can correspond to multiple public keys, and each public key can correspond to an address. The address is converted by some mathematical logic transformation of the public key. When the other party knows the address or the public key, the private key and the address can not be deduced. If the other party knows the private key, the public key and the address can be deduced.</string>
    <string name="AnswerIssue3Ansuer3">                     When sending a transaction, the sender only needs to provide the signature of the public key to complete the issue of the transaction or the transfer of assets.</string>
    <string name="AnswerIssue4">                            4. What will happen if the user accidentally loses his private key?</string>
    <string name="AnswerIssue4Ansuer1">                     Losing the private key becomes equivalent to losing the unique credentials. All assets in the address corresponding to the private key will be lost permanently. There is no way to transfer and trade. Nor can assets be recovered by any external means.</string>
    <string name="AnswerIssue4Ansuer2">                     Without any consequences, a new private key and address can be generated and the assets can be transferred.</string>
    <string name="AnswerIssue5">                            5. If the user publishes the public key, will there be any privacy leak?</string>
    <string name="AnswerIssue5Ansuer1">                     It can query the identity of the holder corresponding to the address on the corresponding "block browser" or obtain the real information of the user through other means such as "human flesh search".</string>
    <string name="AnswerIssue5Ansuer2">                     Block chains have the characteristics of "anonymity". There is no way to know the real information of the user who holds the address assets except that the user publicly acknowledges and proves that the private key of an address belongs to himself. There is absolutely no need to worry about privacy disclosure.</string>

III.The service content\n
1. Create or import a wallet. For digital tokens supported by ANT Token, you can use ANT Token to generate a new wallet or import a compatible wallet generated by other wallet tools in the relevant blockchain system.\n
2. Transfer, collection. You can use the transfer and collection function of ANT Token to manage digital tokens, that is, use the private key for electronic signature and modify the ledger of the relevant blockchain. Transfer means that the payer uses the blockchain address of the payee to perform the transfer operation. The actual transfer and collection behaviors occur in the relevant blockchain system (not ANT Token).\n
3. Quotes view. You can use ANT Token to view the digital token exchange rate prices provided. ANT Token captures the corresponding digital token exchange rate information and displays it in the "Market" section of the ANT Token.\n
4. Manage digital assets. You can use ANT Token to add, keep, and remove digital tokens supported by ANT Token.\n
5. Browse the DApp. Through the link on the ANT Token, the user can jump to the DApp and use the services provided by the DApp (including our own DApp and third-party DApp).\n
6. Transaction history. We will copy all or part of your transaction history through the blockchain system. However, the transaction records are subject to the records of the blockchain system.\n
7. Suspend service. You know that based on the "irrevocable" nature of the blockchain system transaction, we cannot suspend or cancel the transfer transaction, etc., but under certain circumstances, we can suspend or restrict the operation of a user to the ANT Token software.\n
8. Other services that we think are necessary.\n
    Users should be aware of the following common issues when accepting the above services we provide:\n
1. Adhering to the decentralization of the blockchain, and in order to protect the digital token security of users, we provide decentralized services, which are greatly different from banking financial institutions. Users understand that we do not provide the following services:\n
\t(1) store the user is wallet password (that is, the password set when the user creates/imports the wallet), the private key, the mnemonic, and the Keystore;\n
\t(2) Retrieve the user is wallet password, private key, mnemonic, Keystore;\n
\t(3) freezing the wallet;\n
\t(4) Lost the wallet;\n
\t(5) Restoring the wallet;\n
\t(6) The transaction is rolled back.\n
    2. Since we do not provide the above services, users should keep their own mobile devices with ANT Token, backup ANT Token, backup wallet password, mnemonic, private key and Keystore. If the user loses the mobile device, deletes and does not back up the ANT Token, deletes and does not back up the wallet, the wallet is stolen or forgotten the wallet password, private key, mnemonic, Keystore, we are unable to restore the wallet or retrieve the wallet password, private key, Mnemonic, Keystore; if the user mishandles the transaction (such as the wrong transfer address), we can not cancel the transaction.\n
3. The Digital Token Management Service that the Foundation and ANT Token can provide does not include all existing digital tokens. Do not operate any digital tokens that are not supported by ANT Token through ANT Token.\n
4. ANT Token is only the user is digital token management tool, not an exchange or trading platform. Although this Agreement will refer to “transactions” many times, its behavior generally refers to the transfer and collection operations performed by users using ANT Token, which is fundamentally different from “transactions” conducted on exchanges or trading platforms.\n
5. The DApp integrated on ANT Token includes our own DApp and DApp provided by third-party platforms. For DApps provided by third-party platforms, ANT Token only provides blockchain browsers for users to enter DApp. Before accepting services or conducting transactions on a third-party DApp, users should judge and evaluate whether the services or transactions provided by the third-party DApp are at risk.\n

    <string name="RedEnvelopeMoneyandFirendError">                                     The amount or the friend who received the red packet is not filled out</string>
    <string name="readAgreementHint">\t\tPrivate keys are the entrance to a digital wallet. Only private keys can prove that you are the owner of the assets in the wallet, and no one knows these private keys except you. This is the biggest difference between de centralization and centralization. Your digital assets are under your own control and there is no centralized institution involved.\n
\t\tPrivate key is a 32 byte random number generated by the Elliptic Curve Encryption algorithm. It consists of 64 hexadecimal characters, and a wallet has only one private key, which can not be modified. It is your only identity certificate on the chain. A private key can correspond to multiple public keys, and each public key can correspond to an address, which is changed by some mathematical logic through the public key. Conversely, it is impossible to deduce the private key when the address or public key is known, but when the private key is known, the public key and address can be deduced.\n
\t\tBlock chains have the characteristics of "anonymity". There is no way to know the real information of the user who holds the address assets except that the user publicly acknowledges and proves that the private key of an address belongs to himself. There is absolutely no need to worry about privacy disclosure.\n
\t\tMnemonic words are usually composed of 12 random words, in other words, mnemonic words are another form of private key. It converts 64 bit private keys into several common English words or vocabulary versions in other languages through algorithms.\n
\t\tYou can understand mnemonics as different forms of private keys, need backup, and try to record them with paper notes when backing up. You can let your family keep one, keep one by themselves, do not save it on the network, such as cloud notes, chat records, etc. If you change your mobile phone, you can restore your wallet by backing up. You can import your wallet through mnemonics, but conversely, if someone else gets your mnemonics, you can transfer your assets, so keep your mnemonics properly.\n
\t\tIf the private key loses or forgets the private key password, without backup mnemonics, it is equivalent to losing the only credentials. All assets in the address corresponding to the private key will be lost permanently. There is no way to transfer and trade, nor can assets be recovered by any external means.\n
\t\tPlaintext Private Key: 64 bit hexadecimal hash value string, with a sentence to illustrate the importance of plaintext private key: "Who has the private key, who has the right to use the wallet!" \n
\t\tThe world of block chain is still a little different from reality. For example, if you forget your bank card password, you can take your ID card to the bank and reset the password yourself. And the private key of the digital wallet, you forgot, and there is no backup mnemonic, then nobody can help you, contact customer service, provide mobile phone authentication code, wallet address and so on can not be retrieved, because this is a decentralized DAPP, will not store the user is private key, all private keys are stored only in the user is local.\n
\t\tYou can test it on the same phone, or you can test it on another phone to verify that the backup is correct.\n
\t\tThe same mobile phone import, if the original wallet exists, will tell you that the wallet already exists, indicating that the backup is correct.\n
\t\tDifferent mobile phone imports, can be imported successfully, although the name is different, but the address is the same, the instructions are also noted right.
